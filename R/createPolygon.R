  #fraction: the minimum fraction of occurrences that must be included in the polygon - 70%
  #buff: buffering distance in meters - 1000. This should be adjusted considering OBIS buffering
  #partCount: the maximum number of disjunct polygons that are allowed. I set this to a high number to allow for global distribution and multiple polygons.
  #clipToCoast: Either "no" (no clipping), "terrestrial" (only terrestrial part of the range is kept) or "aquatic" (only non-terrestrial part is clipped).
