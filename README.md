## Overview
**remora** is an R package enabling the integration of animal acoustic telemetry data with oceanographic observations collected by ocean observing programs. It includes functions for:

- Interactively exploring animal movements in space and time from acoustic telemetry data
- Performing robust quality-control of acoustic telemetry data as described in [Hoenner et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.206) 
- Identifying available satellite-derived and sub-surface *in situ* oceanographic datasets coincident and collocated with the animal movement data, based on regional Ocean Observing Systems  
- Extracting and appending these environmental data to animal movement data  

Whilst the functions in **remora** were primarily developed to work with acoustic telemetry data, the environmental data extraction and integration functionalities will work with other spatio-temporal ecological datasets (eg. satellite telemetry, species sightings records, fisheries catch records).

## Installation
**remora** requires R version >= 3.6.0

You will need the remotes package to install **remora**:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")     
```
The latest stable version of **remora** can be installed from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github('IMOS-AnimalTracking/remora', build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Key functionalities
<p align="center">
  <img src="vignettes/images/workflow_diagram.png">
</p>

A set of functions within the **remora** workflow allow users to run each of the below functionalities independently, as required. 

- Interactive visualisation of data associated with an acoustic telemetry receiver array
- Interactive visualisation of data associated with an acoustic telemetry tagging project
- Quality control of acoustic telemetry data
- Integration with remotely-sensed or gridded environmental data  
- Integration with *in situ* sub-surface oceanographic moooring data

The vignettes for each functionality can be accessed in R using the following code:  

```r
browseVignettes(package = "remora")
```

## What to do if you encounter a problem

If you are convinced you have encountered a bug or
unexpected/inconsistent behaviour when using remora, you can post an
issue [here](https://github.com/IMOS-AnimalTracking/remora/issues). First, have
a read through the posted issues to see if others have encountered the
same problem and whether a solution has been offered. You can reply to
an existing issue if you have the same problem and have more details to
share or you can submit a new issue. 

To submit an issue, you will need
to *clearly* describe the issue, include a reproducible
example, describe what you expected to
happen (but didn’t), and provide screenshots/images that illustrate the problem.

## How to Contribute

Contributions from anyone in the Movement Ecology/Acoustic Telemetry
communities are welcome. Consider submitting a feature request
[here](https://github.com/IMOS-AnimalTracking/remora/issues/new/choose) to start
a discussion. Alternatively, if your idea is well-developed then you can
submit a pull request for evaluation
[here](https://github.com/IMOS-AnimalTracking/remora/pulls).
