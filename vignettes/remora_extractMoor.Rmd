--------------------------------------

Another key functionality of the `remora` package allows users to integrate acoustic telemetry data with physical and biological parameters collected on the [IMOS National Mooring Network](https://imos.org.au/facilities/nationalmooringnetwork). The National Mooring Network is a collection of mooring arrays strategically positioned in Australian coastal waters that includes regional arrays of shelf moorings, acidification moorings, acoustic observatories and a network of National Reference Stations. This package allows the user to match environmental data collected from these mooring stations to each tag detection. Associating environmental data to detections provides a means to analyse environmental or habitat drivers of occurrence, presence and movement of animal monitored using acoustic telemetry. 

We advocate for users to first undertake a quality control step using the `runQC()` function and workflow before further analysis, however the functionality to append environmental data will work on any dataset that has at the minimum spatial coordinates and a timestamp for each detection event. Currently, the focus of this package is to integrate animal telemetry data and environmental data housed within the [Integrated Marine Observing System](https://imos.org.au), and therefore primarily focuses within Australia. As this package develops, more sources of environmental data will be added to allow for users to access more datasets across Australia and globally.

<br>

# Types of environmental data

This package allows users to access a range of ocean datasets that have undergone a quality control process and housed within the [Integrated Marine Observing System](https://imos.org.au) database and can also be explored through the [Australian Ocean Data Network portal](https://portal.aodn.org.au). There are primarily two types of environmental data that users can currently access:

*1. Remote sensed environmental data*

*2. In-situ environmental data from moorings at fixed locations*

<br>

The `imos_variables()` function will help the user identify currently available environmental layers that can be accessed and associated. Variables include spatial layers including `bathy` and `dist_to_land`, which provide distance measures of bathymetry (in meters) and proximity to land (in kilometers). Variable names that start with `rs_` are remote sensed environmental layers, and variables starting with `moor_` include in-situ environmental layers.


```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

<br>

In this vignette we will explore accessing and extracting in-situ data from the [IMOS National Mooring Network](https://imos.org.au/facilities/nationalmooringnetwork). A suite of additional functions is also available to access enbvironmental data gatehred via remote sensing (see `extractEnv()`; [link to Vinay's vignette]()).

# Usage of the `extractMoor()` function

## Load example dataset

The primary function to extract and append in-situ data collected by the [IMOS National Mooring Network](https://imos.org.au/facilities/nationalmooringnetwork) to acoustic detection data is the `extractMoor()` function.
Lets start with a dataset that has undergone quality control (see `runQC()`; [link to Ians vignette]()).

```{r, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Example dataset that has undergone quality control using the `runQC()` function
data("TR_qc")

## Un-nest the output and retain detections flagged as 'valid' and 'likely valid' (Detection_QC 1 and 2)
qc_data <- TR_qc %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(QC) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Detection_QC %in% c(1,2)) 

```

<br>

Lets have a quick look at the spatial patterns in detection data for each tag deployment:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)

qc_data %>% 
  group_by(transmitter_id, station_name, installation_name, receiver_deployment_longitude, receiver_deployment_latitude) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(num_det = n()) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  annotation_map_tile('cartolight') +
  geom_spatial_point(aes(x = receiver_deployment_longitude, 
                         y = receiver_deployment_latitude, 
                         size = num_det, 
                         color = installation_name), 
                     crs = 4326) +
  facet_wrap(~transmitter_id,nrow=3) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```
![ ](images/env_extract/env_extract_plot1.png)
<br>

We can also have a look at the temporal pattern in detections:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
qc_data %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(detection_datetime)) %>% 
  group_by(transmitter_id, date, installation_name) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(num_det = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = transmitter_id, color = installation_name, size = num_det)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Moorings data source

Lets have a quick look at the spatial arrangement of the IMOS National Mooring Network.

In this example, we will identify and plot the location of moorings in Australian coastal waters which have records of *sea water temperature*

Each variable will need to be accessed one at a time using the `mooringDownload()` function. 
There is only one parameters within the function that can help the user identify the variable required:

+ **sensorType**: the name of the environmental variable to download and append. This can be `temperature`, `velocity`, `salinity`, `oxygen`.
<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Generate a table containing IMOS moorings metadata for only those moorings with temperature data
moorT <- mooringTable(sensorType="temperature")

# PLot the location of the moorings with associated metadata
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addMarkers(lng = moorT$longitude, lat = moorT$latitude,
             popup = paste("Site code", moorT$site_code,"<br>",
                           "URL:", moorT$url, "<br>",
                           "Standard names:", moorT$standard_names, "<br>",
                           "Coverage start:", moorT$time_coverage_start, "<br>",
                           "Coverage end:", moorT$time_coverage_end))
```
![ ](images/moor_extract/moor_extract_plot3.png)
<br>

## Find closest mooring to our animal detections

To identify which is the appropriate mooring with which to append to our acoustic detections, we'll run the `getDistance()` function. This function will assign the `moor_site_code` of the closest mooring to each tag detection, the straight line distance of the mooring to the receiver station location (`closest_moor_km`), along with the mooring's temporal coverage (`moor_coverage_start` and `moor_coverage_end`), and whether or not the `detection_datetime` stamp falls within this coverage period (`is.coverage` = TRUE/FALSE).

In this function, the user specifies which detection dataset with which they which to merge with the available moorings data.  

+ **moorLocations**: the dataframe containing the locations of the IMOS moorings generated using the `mooringTable()` function.
+ **trackingData**: the dataframe containing acoustic detection data in IMOS QC format

<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#Extract the nearest mooring to each station where a tag was detected
det_dist <- getDistance(trackingData = qc_data, 
                        moorLocations = moorT)
```

## 

In order to identify which moorings do not have temporal coverage during the period when tag detections were obtained, we have provided the `getOverlap()` function. In this function, we simply enter the detection dataset (`det_dist`) which also contains the nearest moorings data generated using the above `getDistance()` function. What is returned is a table containing the proportion of tag detections that fell within the coverage period of the mooring deployment at which it was assigned: `moor_site_code`, `moor_coverage_start` and `moor_coverage_end`.

<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Which moorings have overlapping data with detections?
mooring_overlap <- getOverlap(det_dist)
mooring_overlap
```

As `Poverlap = 1` for all three moorings datasets, all our detections have temporal overlap with these mooring deployments. IF some of the moorings had partial/no coverage during the tag release period, we would consider dropping these from the moorT object before re-running the `getDistance()` function.

Let's plot the spatial arrangement of these mooring stations on an interactive map with our tag detections at receiver stations.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Filter for only those moorings which are closest to receivers and also have overlapping detection intervals
moorT_new <- moorT %>% 
  filter(site_code %in% mooring_overlap$moor_site_code)

#Summarise dataset so only a single row per receiver station
qs_stat <- qc_data %>% 
  group_by(station_name, installation_name, 
           receiver_deployment_longitude, 
           receiver_deployment_latitude) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(num_det = n(),
            first_detection = min(detection_datetime),
            last_detection = max(detection_datetime))

# make palette for number of detections at stations
library(viridisLite)
domain <- range(qs_stat$num_det) # get domain of numeric data for colour scalse
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = viridis(100), domain = domain)

# Draw the map
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addMarkers(lng = moorT_new$longitude, lat = moorT_new$latitude, 
             popup = paste("Site code", moorT_new$site_code,"<br>",
                           "URL:", moorT_new$url, "<br>",
                           "Standard names:", moorT_new$standard_names, "<br>",
                           "Start:", moorT_new$time_coverage_start, "<br>",
                           "End:", moorT_new$time_coverage_end)) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data=qs_stat,
                   lng = qs_stat$receiver_deployment_longitude, 
                   lat = qs_stat$receiver_deployment_latitude,
                   radius = 6,
                   color=~pal(num_det),
                   stroke=FALSE,
                   fillOpacity=0.5,
                   popup = paste("Station name", qs_stat$station_name,"<br>",
                                 "Installation name:", qs_stat$installation_name, "<br>",
                                 "Tag detections:", qs_stat$num_det, "<br>",
                                 "First tag detection:",qs_stat$first_detection, "<br>",
                                 "Last tag detection:",qs_stat$last_detection))
```

<br>

## Moorings data download

Now that we have matched each animal detection with an appropriate `moor_site_code`, we will download the data time series for *moorings derived water temperature* for each mooring site code from the AODN Thredds file sever.

Although this function provides the capacity to download various sensor types (i.e. `temperature`, `velocity`, `salinity` or `oxygen`), each variable can only be accessed one at a time using the `mooringDownload()` function. The netCDF files should then be saved locally within the working directory (e.g. within the folder ` imos.cache/moor/temperature`). 

There are a few parameters within the function that can help the user identify the variable required, and to manage the downloaded environmental layers:

+ **moor_site_codes**: a vector containing the names of the mooring sites to download 
+ **sensorType**: the name of the environmental variable to download and append (see `imos_variables()` for available variables and variable names)
+ **fromWeb**: should the environmental data layers be directly loaded from the web (`TRUE`) or uploaded from an existing folder within the working directory (`FALSE`)?  
+ **file_loc**: the name of the folder within the working directory where the NetCDFs will be saved (if `fromWeb = TRUE`) or uploaded (if `fromWeb = FALSE`)
+ **itimeout**: number of seconds we are willing to wait before timeout to download netcdf from the web. Defaults to 60

<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
## Creates vector of moorings that we want to download
moorIDs <- unique(mooring_overlap$moor_site_code)

## Download each net cdf from the Thredds server to a specified folder
## set fromWeb = FALSE if loading from an existing folder within the working directory
moorDat.l <- mooringDownload(moor_site_codes = moorIDs, 
                             sensorType="temperature", 
                             fromWeb = TRUE, 
                             file_loc="imos.cache/moor/temperature",
                             itimeout=240)
names(moorDat.l) # What moorings datasets do we have in memory
#[1] "GBRMYR" "GBRPPS" "NRSYON"
```

<br>

As we set `fromWeb` to `TRUE`, the downloaded layers will be cached within the specified **file_loc** folder within the working directory. Each time the function is called, downloaded layers are cached into this folder.

When downloading `temperature` data, two variables are downloaded: sensor depth (`moor_depth`) and sea temperature (`moor_sea_temp`). 

When downloading `current` data, three variables are downloaded: sensor depth (`moor_depth`), surface geostrophic velocity in the north-south direction (`moor_vcur`) and the east-west direction (`moor_ucur`). 

When downloading `salinity` data, two variables are downloaded: sensor depth (`moor_depth`), and sea water practical salinity (`moor_psal`). 

When downloading dissolved `oxygen` data, four variables are downloaded: sensor depth (`moor_depth`), `moor_mole_concentration_of_dissolved_molecular_oxygen_in_sea_water`, `moor_moles_of_oxygen_per_unit_mass_in_sea_water` and `moor_volume_concentration_of_dissolved_molecular_oxygen_in_sea_water`. 
<br>


## Creating a depth-time plot using moorings data, and adding detections

We can use the moorings data we've extracted to plot an interactive depth-time plot showing three-dimensional variability in the physical parameter of interest over a specified time period, and then plot the animal tracking detections which are close to this mooring. When hovering on the plot, a vertical line will appear so that it is easier to find the environmental variable associated to the detection.

For example, we might want to plot temperature over depth at the GBRPPS mooring, `GBRPPS`, and then add all the bull shark detections over the same time period from the closest IMOS Animal Tracking Facility installation.


```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
plotDT(moorData=moorDat.l$GBRPPS, # have GBRMYR, GBRPPS and NRSYON available
       moorName="GBRPPS",
       dateStart="2013-11-01", 
       dateEnd="2014-02-01", 
       varName="temperature",
       trackingData=det_dist,
       speciesID="Carcharhinus leucas",
       IDtype="species_scientific_name",
       detStart="2013-11-01", 
       detEnd="2014-02-01")

```
![ ](images/moor_extract/moor_extract_plot5.png)

We can also visualise current `velocity` data with the detections, where moorings have velocity sensors. For example, we can visualise the zonal, North-South (v) velocity (`vcur`) at the the same mooring, and plot the bull shark detections associated with that mooring.

We need to make sure that the NetCDF file we have stored locally contains the velocity data. To achieve this, we firsty need to download this netCDF file using the `mooringDownload()` function and then save the file to a different folder location, in this case `imos.cache/moor/velocity`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
plotDat.l <- mooringDownload(moor_site_codes = "GBRPPS", 
                             fromWeb = TRUE, # Download the netCDF. If already downloaded, set as FALSE
                             sensorType="velocity", # sensor data to download
                             file_loc="imos.cache/moor/velocity", # Location where the netCDF is stored/saved
                             itimeout=240) 
            
# plot the moorings data
plotDT(moorData=plotDat.l$GBRPPS, 
       moorName="GBRPPS",
       dateStart="2013-11-01", 
       dateEnd="2014-02-01", 
       varName = "vcur",
       trackingData=det_dist,
       speciesID="Carcharhinus leucas",
       IDtype="species_scientific_name",
       detStart="2013-11-01",
       detEnd="2014-02-01")
```

## Moorings data extraction
Say we wanted to match each animal tag detection to the nearest mooring sensor value. How would we achieve this?

In this example, we will extract *moorings derived water temperature* collected from the nearest sensor in the [IMOS National Mooring Network](https://imos.org.au/facilities/nationalmooringnetwork) to a tag detection at an acoustic receiver.

Sea water `temperature`, current `velocity`, or `salinity` data can be accessed one at a time using the `extractMoor()` function. There are a few parameters within the function that can help the user identify the variable required, and to manage the downloaded environmental layers:

+ **trackingData**: the data frame with the detection data
+ **file_loc**: the name of the folder where the NetCDF files for the moorings are stored
+ **sensorType**: name of mooring sensor to query. Can be `temperature`, `velocity` or `salinity`.
+ **timeMaxh**: optional numeric string containing the maximum time threshold in hours to merge detection and mooring sensor values. To run function without a timeout threshold, set as `Inf`.
+ **distMaxkm**: optional numeric string containing the maximum distance threshold in kilometers to include in output. To run function without distance threshold, set as `Inf`.
+ **targetDepthm**: extracts the nearest sensor to this depth value. Set as `NA` to return all sensor records at this mooring
+ **scalc**: when there are two options for sensors nearest the idepth provided, should the lower (`min`) or higher (`max`) depth value be returned? Users can also specify a `mean` of the available values, or `NA` to return both sensor values. 

<br>

By default, each of the environmental sensors positioned on a mooring will be returned for a certain timestamp. For example, if 10 sensors are positioned on a mooring, each hourly timestamp for that mooring witll have 10 sensor readings.  

<br>
```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_with_mooring_sst_all <- extractMoor(trackingData = det_dist,
                                         file_loc="imos.cache/moor/temperature",
                                         sensorType = "temperature",
                                         timeMaxh = Inf,
                                         distMaxkm = Inf)
```

We can see the extracted environmental variables are appended as new columns to the input dataset as a nested tibble. You can look at the contents of this by using the `unnest()` function in the `tidyr` package.

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data_with_mooring_sst_all # By default the output is a nested tibble

# Unnest tibble to reveal the first 10 rows of the data
data_with_mooring_sst_all %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(cols = c(data))
```

<br>


If we wanted to extract the sensor positioned at the shallowest depth available on a mooring, we can do so by setting the parameter `idepth = 0`. Alternatively if there is a preferred depth at which you would like to extract, the function will select the nearest sensor to this value.  
<br>

You can increase the sensitivity of the `extractMoor()` function by setting a maximum time threshold (in hours) for the period you are willing to allow between tag detection and mooring timestamps (`timeMaxh`). You can also add a distance threshold (`distMaxkm`) for maximum allowed distance (in kilometers) between moorings and receiver station locations.

In this example, we will limit our function so that only detections within 24h and 50km of moorings are allocated with sensor value readings. 

As each mooring line has multiple sensors deployed at various depths, we can specify which sensor we want returned by setting a `targetDepthm`. Here we set this as `targetDepthm=0` to return the sensor value that is nearest to the water surface.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Run the same function again with time and distance thresholds
# and when multiple sensors are available return the shallowest value at that time stamp
data_with_mooring_sst_shallow <- extractMoor(trackingData = det_dist,
                                             file_loc="imos.cache/moor/temperature",
                                             sensorType = "temperature",
                                             timeMaxh = 24,
                                             distMaxkm = 50,
                                             targetDepthm=0, 
                                             scalc="min")

data_with_mooring_sst_shallow
```

Notice that this new merged dataset `data_with_mooring_sst_shallow` is now much smaller than the original one `data_with_mooring_sst_all`? This is because we have extracted only selected a single sensor value for each detection timestamp. We have also dropped those rows from the dataset which not did meet the time and distance thresholds.   

<br>

##Examining the appended environmental data
Now let's see how the detections of our tagged animals corresponded with variations in sea water temperature. First let's add the in-situ temperature values to the detection plots grouped by `transmitter_id`:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summarised_data_id <-
  data_with_mooring_sst_shallow %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(cols = c(data)) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(detection_datetime)) %>% 
  group_by(transmitter_id, date) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(num_det = n(),
            mean_temperature = mean(moor_sea_temp, na.rm = T))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(summarised_data_id, aes(x = date, y = transmitter_id, size = num_det, color = mean_temperature)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(subtitle = "In-situ sea water temperature (°C)") +
  theme_bw()
``` 
![ ](images/moor_extract/moor_extract_plot7.png)
<br>

Alternatively we can view the appended detection plots grouped by `station_name` for only those installations which have mooring sensor data associated with it:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summarised_data_id <-
  data_with_mooring_sst_shallow %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(cols = c(data)) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(detection_datetime)) %>% 
  group_by(installation_name, date) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(num_det = n(),
            mean_temperature = mean(moor_sea_temp, na.rm = T)) #%>% drop_na(mean_temperature)


ggplot(summarised_data_id, aes(x=date,y=installation_name,
                               size=num_det,color=mean_temperature)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(subtitle = "In-situ sea water temperature (°C)") +
  theme_bw()
``` 
![ ](images/moor_extract/moor_extract_plot8.png)
<br>

Finally, we can plot the sensor values associated to a detection as a histogram showing the number of detection records associated with each sensor value.

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(hrbrthemes)
# First plot the temperature data
data_with_mooring_sst_shallow %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(cols = c(data)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=moor_sea_temp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1,fill="#69b3a2",color="#e9ecef",alpha=0.9) +
  facet_wrap(~installation_name,scales="free_y",drop=TRUE) +
  ggtitle("In-situ sea water temperatures when bull sharks present (°C)") +
  #theme_ipsum() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size=15)
  )
```  
![ ](images/moor_extract/moor_extract_plot9.png)
```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Next plot the depth data
data_with_mooring_sst_shallow %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(cols = c(data)) %>% 
  drop_na(moor_sea_temp) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=moor_depth)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5, fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
  ggtitle("Depths of sea water temperature readings (m)") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size=15)
