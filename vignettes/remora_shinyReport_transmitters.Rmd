--------------------------------------

The `remora` package includes statistics and data visualisations for acoustic telemetry **receiver array** and **tagging** projects. The `shinyReport()` function allows users to create an interactive data report for their projects, which comprises a range of visualisations and analytical tools to aid data exploration and project management. The resulting plots and tables  can be downloaded for further use and analysis. This interactive report is an exploratory tool and should not be considered an extensive analysis toolkit. 

Currently, the focus of the `remora` package is to integrate animal telemetry data and oceanographic observations collated by Australia's [Integrated Marine Observing System](https://imos.org.au). Therefore, the geographical scope of available datasets is currently restricted to the Australiasia region. 
<br>

---------------------------------------

# Tagging Project

The receiver array report provides users with basic summary statistics and data visualisations for their acoustic telemetry receiver array project. When called, the function produces an interactive Shiny App that will open in the user's default internet browser.


## Run Shiny App
<br>
The `remora` package should be installed prior to calling the functions described in this vignette.

The `shinyReport()` function requires the user to specify the type of report to produce. Two options are available depending on whether the user wishes to produce a report for their receiver array project (`receivers`) or tagging project (`transmitters`). 

This vignette describes the receiver array (`transmitters`) report.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("IMOS-AnimalTracking/remora")
shinyReport("transmitters")
```
<br>

The `shinyReport()` function will generate a pop-up window enabling the user to navigate and select the detections data .CSV file for the receiver array project of their choice. Once this file is loaded, another pop-up window will appear prompting the user to select the corresponding receiver deployment metadata file. These files can be accessed via the [IMOS Australian Animal Acoustic Telemetry Database](https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/projects). Alternatively, the user can select their own data, previously formatted to match the IMOS database output format.

In this vignette, a sample dataset from the Townsville Reefs project (Heupel et al. 2021) archived in the [IMOS Australian Animal Acoustic Telemetry Database](https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/projects) is presented.

## Transmitter deployments

<br>

Map of the transmitter deployments colour coded by species. The user can filter by species and/or date of the transmitter deployment.

When hovering on the bubbles additional information appears with the coordinates, station name and number of detections. 



<br>

## Transmitter detections

<br>

Bar plot of the number of detections per transmitter colour coded by species. The user can filter to by transmitters and/or species.

When hovering on the bars additional information appears with the species common name, number of detections, station name and transmitter id. The plot can be downloaded by clicking on the camera icon on the top right corner.

The summary table on the left panel shows the transmitter ID, number of detections per transmitter and species common name. The table can be downloaded as .CSV, Excel or PDF by clicking on the respective button.

## Detections over time

This tab comprises the abacus and connectivity plot. Users can filter both plots by transmitter(s) and date range. If the date is out of range a warning message will appear.



### Abacus plot

<br>

Interactive plot of the detections for the transmitter(s) selected colour coded by installation. When hovering on the plot, additional information is shown (transmitter ID, detection date and number of detections).

The abacus plot can be saved by clicking on the camera icon in the top right corner of the plot. 

<br>

### Connectivity plot

<br>

The plot represents movement connections between receiver stations and installations visited by the selected transmitter(s).Colours identify separate installations and line thickness highlights the importance of these movement paths within the dataset.

The connectivity plot can be saved by clicking on the "Download plot" button.

## Detections network map 
<br>

The detections network map contains a leaflet map with the detections network for the transmitter selected. Each bubble represents the station at which the transmitter was detected and they are colour coded by number of detections (see legend on the right side of the map). The left panel shows the species common name, the total number of detections, stations and installations. <span style="color: red;">The user has to select a transmitter in order for the map to show the network.</span> 

Note that the map takes more time to load when the transmitter had higher number of detections.
