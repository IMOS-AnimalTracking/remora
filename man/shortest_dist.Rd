\title{find least-cost distance between two locations}
\usage{
shortest_dist(position, inst, rast, tr)
}
\arguments{
\item{position}{locations of deployment and subsequent detections as a
data.frame of longitude, latitude}

\item{inst}{installation names of detection (receiver) locations}

\item{rast}{raster of telemetry region coastline}

\item{tr}{transition matrix for calculating least-cost distances (ie. produced
via transition, with geoCorrection applied)}
}
\value{
a 1-column matrix of shortest distances
}
\description{
calculates least-cost distance between two receiver locations
if a land mass lies between them. Only applied on tags detected more than once
